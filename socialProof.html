        Scenario 5 - Social Proof
    </div>
    <div class="scenario-box">
        An attacker will use social proof to gain unauthorized access to an organization's building by convincing employees walking by that they forgot their card at home and just need to get into the building. The more people he asks and are near the conversation will start paying attention to what he's saying, making it more believable. Eventually, someone who's seen enough will just let the attacker tailgate them into the building. Once inside, the attacker can do a multitude of things from connecting to the network to downloading unauthorized files.

    <div class="explanation-header">
        Explanation
    </div>
    <div class="explanation-box">
        Because the attacker was persistent and was noticed by many employees, it was easy for him to employ the social proof principle, convincing enough people around him that he forgot his card at home, allowing him to gain access to the organization's building.
