        Scenario 6 - Reciprocity 
    </div>
    <div class="scenario-box">
        An attacker uses the principle of reciprocity by impersonating a fellow employee that they know is owed a favor by a certain colleague. They will contact that specific employee via an identical fake email or WhatsApp account asking for files to be sent to them, making it seem like they forgot to take them home with them. That colleague will feel obliged as they have been helped by this person before and transfer the files, allowing the attacker to gain access to the sensitive data.

    <div class="explanation-header">
        Explanation
    </div>
    <div class="explanation-box">
        The attacker has utilized the principle of reciprocity to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data/files because the other employee feels obligated to do so as the person the attacker is impersonating has helped them in the past.
