        Scenario 3 - Liking
    </div>
    <div class="scenario-box">
        An attacker using the Liking principle will possibly impersonate a fellow colleague or employee the victim knows well by creating a near identical email or WhatsApp contact to get them to send over documents they "forgot" or have gone "missing". Because the victim might know this individual on a personal basis they would be willing to send over the documents to help them not get in trouble or help them finish work that wasn't completed in the office.

    <div class="explanation-header">
        Explanation
    </div>
    <div class="explanation-box">
        The attacker has used the principle of liking to receive sensitive data that the victim wouldn't have sent if they received the message from a random person, but with the principle of liking, people are more inclined to help their fellow employees/friends.
