        Scenario 4 - Scarcity 
    </div>
    <div class="scenario-box">
        An attacker has just set up a webpage that looks authentic and is supposedly selling rare earth gems. He sends out mass emails to individuals he knows are into these special gems, hoping one of them will proceed to try and buy one from his website. Once a victim has been pulled in by the use of the scarcity principle and entered their card information into the website, the attacker now has access to use their card.
